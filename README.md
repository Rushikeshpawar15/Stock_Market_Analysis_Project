# Stock_Market_Analysis_Project
This project is a comprehensive stock market data analysis pipeline built with Python. Using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, it explores historical trends, assesses market volatility, and visualizes trading activity. The project provides key financial insights, serving as a strong portfolio piece for data analytics.
What is this project about? 
The main goal was to answer a few key questions about the data:
How have major stock prices changed over time?
Which stocks were the most traded?
How volatile were different stocks?
I used a public dataset and created several charts to show the results in a way that's easy to understand.
What's included in this repository? 
top_10_stock_data.csv: The original dataset used for the analysis.
stock_analysis_notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code. You can follow it step-by-step.
reports/: This folder contains all the charts and images that were created during the analysis.

How can you run it? 
Make sure you have Python installed.
Install the necessary libraries by running this command in your terminal:
Bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tabulate
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (stock_analysis_notebook.ipynb) to see the code and results. You can use an online platform like Google Colab or run it on your local machine.
